Nitty gritty details:
* Pin pad support
* Merge DODF patches (mostly done)
* put generic PEM encoding/decoding functions into libopensc?
* Merge pkcs11 proxy from Zetes
* pkcs11: support decrypt for those cards that have it
* pkcs11: make sure all PIN ops work through pkcs11
* pkcs11: unblock pins: check for unblock pins in AODF
* all: support for RSA-PSS
* pkcs15-init: support SOPIN on Cryptoflex
* pkcs15-init: use max. possible usage by default
* pkcs15-init: during keygen, make sure the pubkey usage is right
* pkcs15-init: when using an unblock PIN, write an AODF entry for it
  (alternatively: set unblockDisabled flag for those PINs that have no PUK?)
* pkcs15: fix sc_pkcs15_change_reference_data; add unblock function
