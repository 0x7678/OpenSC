Description: SmartCard utilities for PKCS#15 compatible cards
 This package includes utilities for using PKCS#15 compatible
 smart cards and similar security tokens.
 .
 These utilities allow the user to initialize, personalize and
 otherwise use PKCS#15 cards with PINs and cryptographic 
 keys.  Users can sign and decrypt data with private keys 
 residing on-card.
 .
 This package also includes the documentation for opensc.
 .
 Supported cards include Gemplus GPK, Schlumberger Cryptoflex,
 Finnish FINEID, Swedish eID, MioCOS and TCOS cards.

Description: SmartCard libraries for PKCS#15 compatible smart cards
 This package contains libraries to use crypto smart cards.
 These libraries allow programs to access data, such as
 cryptographic keys, on various PKCS#15 compatible smart cards
 and similar security tokens.
 .
 This package includes a PKCS#11 Module for Mozilla and other
 PKCS#11 aware application, as well as dynamic engines for OpenSSL.
 .
 See the opensc package for tools and documentation.
 .
 Supported cards include Gemplus GPK, Schlumberger Cryptoflex,
 Finnish FINEID, Swedish eID, MioCOS and TCOS cards.

Description: Pluggable Authentication Module for using PKCS#15 Smart Cards
 This package allows an administrator to configure a host to
 cryptographically authenticate users via PKCS#15 smart cards.
 User certificates can be stored in LDAP or in user home directories,
 to login the smart card with the private key is required.
 .
 This module supports any security token supported by the libopensc libraries.
 .
