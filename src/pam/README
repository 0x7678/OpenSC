Steps required to make the PAM module work:

1. Compile and link the pam_pkcs15.so shared library.
2. Copy pam_pkcs.so to /lib/security.
3. Edit /etc/pam.d/login file. Add the following line before the
   pam_unix.so (on Debian) or pam_pwdb.so (on Red Hat) entry:
	auth	sufficient	/lib/security/pam_pkcs15.so
4. Copy your PEM encoded certificate to a file in your home directory
   called '.eid/authorized_certificates'.
   NOTE: You can use the 'certtest' program to get the PEM encoded
         certificate.
5. Try to login with your card in the reader.
