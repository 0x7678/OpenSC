	Click: Add

	Module name: descriptive name about module (eg. opensc-pkcs11)
	Module file: absolute path of opensc-pkcs11.so


Mozilla:
	Make sure Personal Security Manager (PSM) is installed
	(eg. mozilla-psm package is installed).

	Select menu: Edit -> Preferences

	Select category: Privacy & Security -> Certificates

	Click: Manage Security Devices

	Click: Load

	Module name: descriptive name about module (eg. opensc-pkcs11)

Notes
-----

Netscape seems to show more information about the security module
than mozilla. Otherwise all stuff is untested.	

Please note that the library currently writes debug log to
/tmp/opensc-pkcs11.log.
