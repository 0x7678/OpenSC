Installation
------------

Netscape:
	Select menu: Communicator -> Tools -> Security Info

	Select Cryptographic Modules
	
	Click: Add

	Module name: descriptive name about module (eg. opensc-pkcs11)
	Module file: absolute path of opensc-pkcs11.so

	For proper operation, you also need to configure the module:
	In the Crypthographic Modules dialog, select the OpenSC card,
	and click on the "Config" button to the right. Select the
	"Enable this token" radio button, and select both the "RSA"
	and the "Publicly readable Certs" buttons.

	This will ensure that netscape uses the card when trying to
	display encrypted messages in netscape messenger.  Setting
	"Publicly readable Certs" will also stop a pretty annoying habit
	of netscape which is to ask for all PINs when browsing sites
	requiring client authentication.

Mozilla:
	Make sure Personal Security Manager (PSM) is installed
	(eg. mozilla-psm package is installed).

	Select menu: Edit -> Preferences

	Select category: Privacy & Security -> Certificates

	Click: Manage Security Devices

	Click: Load

	Module name: descriptive name about module (eg. opensc-pkcs11)
	Module file: absolute path of opensc-pkcs11.so


Notes
-----

Netscape seems to show more information about the security module
than mozilla. Otherwise all stuff is untested.
