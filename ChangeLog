Changes between 0.9.6 and 0.9.7 [XX xxx XXXX]

 *) add support for deleting pkcs15 objects. A new
    sc_pkcs15init_operation has been added that must be
    implemented for each card (e.g. see pkcs15-setcos.c).
    [Stef Hoeben]

 *) add support (basic and pkcs15init card driver) for the
    SetCOS 4.4.1 card.
    [Stef Hoeben]

 *) add support for TokenInfo::lastUpdate entry (currently
    the generalizedTime variant). Change pkcs15 cache
    functions to use the lastUpdate field (if present) and
    the card serial number to identify cached files.
    Add 'dirty' flag to 'struct sc_profile' to indicate if
    the TokenUpdate::lastUpdate needs to be updated. If set
    sc_pkcs15init_update_tokeninfo will be called in
    sc_pkcs15init_unbind to update the lastUpdate field.
    [Nils Larsch]

 *) add support (card driver and PKCS#15 emulation) for the
    A-Trust ACos card.
    [Franz Brandl <brandl@a-trust.at>]

 *) add partial PKCS#15 emulation support for GemSAFE cards
    [Douglas E. Engert <deengert@anl.gov>]

 *) add PKCS#15 emulation support for Italian Actalis card.
    [Andrea Frigido <andrea@frisoft.it>]

 *) add PKCS#15 emulation support for Italian Postecert and Cnipa card.
    [Antonino Iacono <ant_iacono@tin.it>]
