README for OpenSC


Introduction
============

libopensc is a library for accessing SmartCard devices using PC/SC Lite
middleware package.  It is also the core library of the OpenSC project.
Basic functionality (e.g. SELECT FILE, READ BINARY) should work on any ISO
7816-4 compatible SmartCard. Encryption and decryption using private keys on
the SmartCard is at the moment possible only with PKCS#15 compatible cards,
such as the FINEID (Finnish Electronic IDentity) card manufactured by
Setec.  Swedish eID Posten card has also confirmed to work.


Building and Installing libopensc
=================================

See the INSTALL file for instructions.  If you are using the CVS version,
you have to run the 'bootstrap' script before running configure.  Please
note that Autoconf, Automake and Libtool are required.


Troubleshooting
===============

A mailing-list has been set up for support and discussion about the
OpenSC project. Additional info is available at OpenSC web site.
