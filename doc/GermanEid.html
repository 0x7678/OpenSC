<p>
German has several laws for smart cards, and to our knowledge all cards conforming to those laws are using the TCOS 2.0X card operating
system. 
</p>
<p>
OpenSC has only some initial support for TCOS cards, but not enough to use those cards with OpenSC. Also there is some code for OpenSC that needs to be ported from an older version of OpenSC to the current, it contains some of the work necessary. 
</p>
<p>
This does NOT mean, that you cannot use preformatted TCOS cards (i.e. <a class="missing" href="/opensc/wiki/NetKey" shape="rect">NetKey?</a> E4-cards) with OpenSC. You find more information about how to use <a class="missing" href="/opensc/wiki/NetKey" shape="rect">NetKey?</a> E4 card <a href="TelseCos.html" shape="rect">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
SignTrust- and German EId-cards are also TCOS based but might have a different layout, so the <a class="missing" href="/opensc/wiki/NetKey" shape="rect">NetKey?</a> E4-emulation might not work with this cards. If you have such a card and know the location of the certificates, keys and PINs, please post this information on the opensc-devel list.
