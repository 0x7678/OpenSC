<p>
OpenSC provides a set of libraries and utilities to access smart
cards. Its main focus is on cards that support cryptographic operations,
and facilitate their use in security applications such as mail encryption,
authentication, and digital signature. OpenSC implements the PKCS#11 API
so applications supporting this API such as Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird
can use it. OpenSC implements the PKCS#15 standard and aims to be compatible
with every software that does so, too.
</p>
<h2>Card Support</h2>
<p>
<a href="CardsAndTokens.html" shape="rect">CardsAndTokens</a> has the full list of all smart cards and tokens.
</p>
<p>
Each release is tested with a subset of the supported cards, and users provide
additional test results. These are collected in <a href="RecentTestresults.html" shape="rect">RecentTestresults</a>.
</p>
<h2>Operating Systems</h2>
<p>
OpenSC runs on Windows, <a href="MacOsX.html" shape="rect">Mac OS X</a> and several other Unix and Bsd flavors.
It is even shipped as integral part of some <a href="LinuxDistributions.html" shape="rect">LinuxDistributions</a>.
</p>
<p>
OpenSC can be integrated with OS-centric cryptography frameworks such as <a href="WindowsCsp.html" shape="rect">WindowsCsp</a>.
</p>
<h2>Card Readers</h2>
<p>
To use OpenSC you need a driver for your smart card reader. This can either be a driver
in CT-API format, or an <a class="missing" href="/opensc/wiki/IfdHandler" shape="rect">IfdHandler?</a> driver in combination with <a class="missing" href="/opensc/wiki/PcscLite" shape="rect">PcscLite?</a>, or <a class="missing" href="/opensc/wiki/OpenCt" shape="rect">OpenCt?</a>.
Most developers use OpenCT in direct combination, i.e. not using the OpenCT CT-API
driver nor the OpenCT ifdhandler with PC/SC-Lite. However those alternatives should
work fine, too.
</p>
<p>
On Win32 platforms you usually get a PC/SC driver. Most <a href="PinpadReaders.html" shape="rect">Pinpad readers</a> (aka Class 2+ readers) also supply  a CT-API driver. Though both drivers can be used with OpenSC you are currently limited to the CT-API driver if you want to use the reader's pinpad.

<h2>Application Support</h2>
<p>
OpenSC comes with a bundle of tools for testing, debugging and initialization.
In addition it contains two <a href="OpensslEngines.html" shape="rect">OpensslEngines</a> that can be combined with OpenSSL to use
the normal OpenSSL commands while using a smart card hardware to do the crypto operations.
</p>
<p>
OpenSC contains a <a class="missing" href="/opensc/wiki/PamModule" shape="rect">PamModule?</a> for authentication/login via smart card. That pam module however
has a few minor bugs. But there is also a new pam module
<a class="ext-link" title="http://oasis.dit.upm.es/~jantonio/pam-pkcs11/" href="http://oasis.dit.upm.es/~jantonio/pam-pkcs11/" shape="rect">for PKCS!#11</a> libaries.
</p>
<p>
OpenSC contains a PKCS#11 library called opensc-pkcs11.so. This library can be used
with <a class="missing" href="/opensc/wiki/MozillaFirebird" shape="rect">MozillaFirebird?</a>, <a class="missing" href="/opensc/wiki/MozillaThunderbird" shape="rect">MozillaThunderbird?</a> or plain Mozilla to login to websites using
certificates from the smart card, or to sign and decrypt eMails or authenticate
to your mail server with your certificate. Keypair generation, certificate request
and writing the requested cert through an on-line CA should also be <a href="pkcs11_keypair_gen.html" shape="rect">possible</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a class="missing" href="/opensc/wiki/FreeSwan/StrongSwan/OpenSwan" shape="rect">FreeSwan/StrongSwan/OpenSwan?</a> can be compiled with OpenSC support and thus be used
to authenticate a VPN connection using a smart card.
</p>
<p>
OpenSSH can be compiled with OpenSC support and thus use the smart card for 
authenticating at a remote ssh server. See <a href="OpenSsh.html" shape="rect">OpenSsh</a> for details.
</p>
<p>
On Windows there is a patched version of Putty with support for PKCS#11 libraries
such as OpenSC. See the <a class="ext-link" title="http://www.opensc.org/scb/" href="http://www.opensc.org/scb/" shape="rect">Smart Card Bundle</a> for a binary
package with installer containing OpenSSL, OpenSC and Putty for Windows.
</p>
<p>
<a class="missing" href="/opensc/wiki/GnuPg" shape="rect">GnuPg?</a> contains support for OpenSC in the experimental 1.9 branch.
</p>
<p>
There is a patch for <a class="missing" href="/opensc/wiki/WpaSupplicant" shape="rect">WpaSupplicant?</a> to allow authentication to access points using
smart cards.
</p>
<p>
<a class="ext-link" title="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gdigidoc" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gdigidoc" shape="rect">Gdigidoc</a> uses <a class="ext-link" title="http://www.openxades.org/" href="http://www.openxades.org/" shape="rect">OpenXAdES</a> library what in turn can make use of OpenSC PKCS#11 module or CSP on windows.

<a href="PuTTYcard.html" shape="rect">Here's a Wikipage</a> that has some information about PuTTYcard, an extension to Simon Tathams PuTTY.
PuTTYcard let you use your Smartcards RSA keys with Pageant.exe.

<p>
<a class="ext-link" title="http://www.libchipcard.de" href="http://www.libchipcard.de" shape="rect">LibChipcard</a> is a library and tools to use all kind of chipcards like HBCI chip cards and german medical cards.
It is used by many online banking applications. The latest development snapshot for version 2 now includes
support for using opensc reader layer. great new!
