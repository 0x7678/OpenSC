<p>
The belgian eid card is official using OpenSC for their software.
</p>
<p>
Currently please use the "belpic" software available from the belgian state.
</p>
<p>
Current releases do not include belpic support, but OpenSC is in the process of merging the software, the next release should support it.

Thanks to Belgium for chossing OpenSC as basis for their software and donating the full source code back to use under LGPL license.
Thanks to Zetes for their support of OpenSC.
