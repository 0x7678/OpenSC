<p>
The <a class="ext-link" title="http://www.openssl.org" href="http://www.openssl.org" shape="rect">OpenSSL project</a> offers the possibility to source out cryptographic functionality to plugin modules called engines. Usually there is one of two reasons for doing this, performance and security. 
</p>
<p>
The performance reason is rather obvious, specialized hardware can do cryptography much faster than a general purpose computer. 
</p>
<p>
The reason for using the opensc-engine typically is a security reason. If you are storing your private keys on a harddisk there is a lot of things an administrator (or a virus with root privileges) can do to steal your key. If the key is on a smart card there is usually no way to export the private key, so if you pull the card from the reader noone can use your keys. And if you use a certified and sealed reader device you can even be reasonably sure that noone can steal your PIN.
